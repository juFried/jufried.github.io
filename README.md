README Last Updated 9/5/2024 

This website is intended to be an autobiography of myself (Justin Friedlander), and to host my sub-projects (completed and in development). I also intend to gain HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Web Design experience through creating this website.

While I have engaged in many projects involving HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Java, and VBA in the 4 years prior to the creation of this website, the majority of those projects were done in teams or in manners in which I could not post them to my personal GitHub profile. This project is intended to learn from, have fun with, and maybe, far down the road, profit from.

I may monetize sub-projects I host/display on this website. Any software or other content from this website may be freely distributed and used for strictly non-commercial purposes.

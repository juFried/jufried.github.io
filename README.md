README Last Updated 9/5/2024 

This website is intended to be an autobiography of myself (Justin Friedlander), and to host my projects/research (completed and in development). I also intend to gain HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Web Design experience through creating this website.

While I have engaged in many projects involving HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Java, C, and VBA in the years prior to the creation of this website, the majority of those projects were done in teams or in manners in which I could not post them to my personal GitHub profile. This project is intended to openly learn from and have fun with.

I may monetize projects I host/display on this website. Any software or other content from this website may be freely distributed and used for strictly non-commercial purposes, unless granted explicit permission.

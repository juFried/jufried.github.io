                                    Outside of my classes, I am freshmen representative of the Tufts
                                    Linux User Group, and I am a member of the Data Science Club and
                                    the Society of Physics Students (SPS).
                                    Furthermore, I enjoy expanding my education through online courses.

                                    I also am an alumnus of Boys State and FRC. FRC (FIRST
                                    Robotics Competition) enables high school students to build
                                    life-sized robots from scratch to compete and to showcase to
                                    children in the community. In 2023, my team competed at the World
                                    Championships in Houston, Texas.

                                    Finally, I competed in chess tournaments where, at the age of 7,
                                    I tied for 21st at the World Youth Chess Championships
                                    before reaching a USCF rating of 1867 at just 9 years old.

                                    Integer factorization is a problem at the core of modern cryptography
                                    approaches such as RSA. As such, much effort has been put towards finding
                                    a fast factorization algorithm. However, no classical algorithm has been
                                    realized to efficiently factor two numbers. In 1994, Peter Shor discovered
                                    an algorithm that could efficiently factor integers using quantum computers.
                                    However, efforts still remain to make better classical or quantum
                                    factorization methods.

                                    This paper recalls a classical approach which runs an integer factorization
                                    algorithm in \(O( \sqrt{n} )\) time. It then provides an outline for how to
                                    improve this time complexity to \(O( n^{\frac{1}{4}} )\) by making use of the
                                    Grover's Search algorithm on a quantum computer.

                                    Numerous methods have been considered to create a fast
                                    integer factorization algorithm. Despite its apparent simplicity,
                                    the difficulty to find such an algorithm plays a crucial role in
                                    modern cryptography, notably, in the security of RSA encryption.
                                    Some approaches to factoring integers quickly include the Trial
                                    Division method, Pollard's Rho and p-1 methods, and various Sieve
                                    algorithms.<br><br>
                                    This paper introduces a new method that converts an integer into a
                                    sum in base-2. By combining a base-10 and base-2 representation of
                                    the integer, an algorithm on the order of \(\sqrt{n}\) time complexity
                                    can convert that sum to a product of two integers, thus factoring
                                    the original number.
